===== Server plugin related issues =====

KillCmd.java --> Working for Brian_Entei on local spigot 1.11.2 test server with minimal plugins
	installed, but apparently not working in "real" server environment containing things like VT
	and other plugins that can interfere, so this needs looking into...

===== SlimeFun4 =====

Entire project needs a thorough looking through to be sure no silly coding mistakes are present,
	be them from us working on it or from the original plugin developers. We're only human! Assume
	nothing!

Machines are not working at this time, this needs looking into.

Need to finish separating cargo tick nodes from other tickable slimefun blocks/machines, but before
	this can be achieved, we need to first figure out how the heck SlimeFun4 handles and schedules
	tick rates.

Once cargo tick nodes and machines are fixed, we(?) need to begin optimizing SlimeFun4's cargo tick()
	method, as it takes up waaay too much time of the spigot server tick time. This will be done by
	moving all non-bukkit API crucial code from the server tick thread and into a background thread
	that will handle memory operations and list sorting/management. The background thread will send
	volatile flags and signals to another class that will be doing the cargo tick() method on the
	server thread, so the server thread will ONLY be doing what it needs to, and nothing more.
	This will need to be thought through carefully and done right the FIRST time. Otherwise, all
	bets are off and any number of issues can pop up from this. If done properly, this should last
	the life of this plugin and not need much updating except to maybe add new features, and that
	will need to be done carefully should that ever become necessary.

===== TE-UniversalEnchant =====

We need to fix the durability when changing tool, meaning if it's a Diamond Pick and changing to
	shears, durability need to be recalculated. We can work in % here to make it easier.
	We also need to add leaves to shear tool instead of axe, maybe it's only a config thing,
	I didn't test yet.
	
===== JoPlugin =====

JoPlugin, add a timetrials resetall command, should be easy, but i keep forgetting that. We also need to
	replace the particles for the itemdrop stuff, the one we currently have is broken in 1.11

Remove the /warp netherportal and add a way like multiverse does, tp that players doesn't have any way
	except entering a netherportal.
	
===== JoMergeMobs =====

I want to replace the mergedmob plugin that is already loaded on the server, because it contains bug
	that I can't fix. Plugin is obfuscated, we'll need to start from scratch. I want to merge mobs
	by listing them in the config file, having an option to load by worlds. We can refer to the merged
	mob config file and start from there.
	Ex: Config
	Mobs:
  	CHICKEN:
   	 alias: "Chickens"
    	 radius: 1
    	 leave_pair: true
    	 merge_type: AVERAGE
    	 max: 9
    	 breeding: true
	 Enabled Worlds(none by default): 
	   - skyworld
	   - SomeRandomWorldHere

===== EggIncubator =====
We need to make this plugins work with luckperms please. ty. https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/egg-incubator-pokemon-go.36149/

===== Titles =====
-----Talabrek-----
I think we need to make some changes to the title plugin. I know Jo was working on it but I want to post some info
here to detail what I think would be good. 

First, I think we should have a GUI interface that players can use to view and select titles. In addition to viewing 
titles that they already have, this could be used to let players see which server titles they can work to obtain, 
giving players a goal to work towards. The title would keep track of the following:

Title name 
Actual title (how it looks in chat)
Status (locked/unlocked)
Description
Where to obtain (if not unlocked)
Date obtained (if unlocked)
Additional Rewards (we could give out secondary prizes when players unlock a title)
Type (prefix, suffix)
Category (public, custom)

For the category, public titles would display to all players whether they are locked or unlocked. Custom titles would
only display if unlocked (only meant for the player that it was created for).

So an example of what it would like look in the GUI:
{
Prefix Title: [Ninja]
LOCKED

Awarded for completing the Ninja
Parkour course.

Where to unlock:
Lobby Server (/lobby)

Additional reward(s) for unlocking:
+10 tokens
}

{
Ninja [Ninja]
UNLOCKED

Awarded for completing the Ninja
Parkour course.

Obtained: 10/8/2015

Click here or use /title ninja to
set this as your prefix title.
}

Another thing is to add the ability for players to have suffix titles. While prefixes are like a tag
for the player, suffixes would be attached to their name like:

Talabrek, Zombie Slayer - Talabrek, Master Miner - Talabrek, Assassin

Or like a last name (we could sell custom ones in the shop and let players make their own):

Talabrek Shadowhunter

So it would be formatted like: [Owner]Talabrek Shadowhunter > Hey guys!

For staff we would either need to add a fixed tag to the end of the name that displays along with the 
suffix (I think we can do this with DeluxeChat) or have the plugin append it. So: 

[Owner]Talabrek Shadowhunter(Owner)
